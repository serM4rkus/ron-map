      <h1>Ready or Maps</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Fan made project to plan your game runs in Ready or Not and find some hidden details.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>📍 Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I created this project because I spend considerable time studying blueprints to prepare for runs with my
          friends.
          I also recognize that sometimes it's difficult to know where to look when searching for hidden objectives, and
          having
          guidance can be invaluable. This is the perfect resource where everything is compiled in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the app features <strong>21 out of 25 available maps</strong>, as I unfortunately lack the skills
          to
          create
          floor plans myself. All maps were sourced from eNex's Steam guide and are used in this project with his
          permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're able to create high-quality floor plans for existing or missing levels, please reach out via Discord
          →
          <strong>serM4rkus</strong>. Will be happy to add your map and also mention in credits.
